# About the game
The Snake game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around abordered playing area, consuming food items whileavoiding obstacles and itself. <br>
Here's how it typically works: <br>
1. Initial Setup: The game begins with a snake
consisting of a single segment and a randomly placed
food item within the playing area. <br>

2. Movement: The player can control the direction of
the snake's movement using arrow keys, WASDkeys.The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction
until it collides with a boundary or itself. <br>

3. Eating Food: When the snake's head comes into
contact with a food item, it consumes the food, and its
length increases by one segment. A new food item
then appears randomly within the playing area.<br>

4. Eating Food: When the snake's head comes into
contact with a food item, it consumes the food, and its
length increases by one segment. A new food item
then appears randomly within the playing area. <br>

5. Growth and Challenge: As the snake grows
longer, maneuvering becomes more challenging
because the player must avoid colliding with the snake's own body.<br>

7. Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the
snake collides with the boundary of the playing
area or with itself. Upon game over, the player's
score is usually displayed, indicating how many food
items the snake managed to consume.
